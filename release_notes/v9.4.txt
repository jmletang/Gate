This version is intended to be used with Geant4 11.2.1 only. 
Gate cannot be compiled with earlier Geant4 versions. 
It *may* works with other ROOT, ITK, libtorch version but it is not tested.

Dependencies:
- Geant4: v11.2.1 (cxx17 is required)
- ROOT: v6-24-06 (must be compiled with -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17)
- ITK: v5.2.0 (with RTK enabled)
- libtorch: v1.10.1


-----------------
Main new features
-----------------

- Possible changes in results (bug corrections):
1) Since Geant4 version 11.0, a time threshold for the radioactive decay of ions has been introduced:

in GateVProcess.cc l.35


- Bug corrections:
1) Add MixMaxRng as an option to the list of random engines PR #665
2) Digitizer merger simplification PR #658
3) Compton Camer digitzer modules are adapted to GND PR #657
4) Digitizer modules adapted: Crosstalk, Buffer, IntrinsicResolution
5) Fixed forced detection fixes PR #646
6) Fixing Memory leaks in GND
7) Add a "invert" command for filters of actors PR #614
8) DNA physics lists and DNA Activator from G4 PR #610
9) Coincidence Digitizer: main module  PR #605

From 9.3 version: 
1) Some of functionalities are temporarily disabled:
          - Coincidence digitizers
          - Outputs: Sino, LMF, Ecat7

New features:
1) vpgTLE-tt: new TLE of prompt gamma with time tagging
2) BioDose Actor
